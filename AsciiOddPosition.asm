.model small
    ;model small tells the assembler that we intend to use the small memory model
	;one code segment, one data segment and one stack segment - and the values of
	;the segment registers are never changed.
.stack 100h
    ;STACK 100h : is a segment directive which defines 100h words as program STACK.
.data
	;the data section is used for declaring initialized data or constants.
.code
    ;This defines an area in memory that stores the instruction codes
